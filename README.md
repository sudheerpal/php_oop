# php_oop
personal notes on oops pattern of programming in PHP language.


## Abstract class (extend is used)
an object cant be initiated using abstract classes.
we need to only define methods in abstract classes and these methods can be defined in object when abstract class get extended.

## Interface (implement is used)
it cant have construct
it can have varibales
it cant have private/protected functions.(it can only have public functions)
